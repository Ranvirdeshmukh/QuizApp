This is the quiz for determining what character of the TV show "Suits you can be"

I generated a static website but it is working with selecting the options and submitting it. I think if you have to do it will have to manually download my 
repo and run it on your computer. Most prolly happening because of the data.json.

## What Worked Well
I think this project went really well. I did a bunch of crazy animation for extra credits using css and js from selection of the options to animations of 
new screen poppin up after submitting the quiz. I think I tried to do the other json extra credit by taking some help from chat gpt but I am not sure how went
it turned out to be.

## Extra Credit
 Yes I did a lot of crazy animations for the wesbite using CSS and Javascript. I also tried to do the other json extra credit but am not sure how well it wnet. from the given ec animations , i added the sweet button animation where the button changes its color as you hover over it. Also, added a really cool animation after selecting the option. And one really cool when for the quiz results.
